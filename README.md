EntityGeneratorBundle
=====================

Bundle to interactively generate entities in Symfony4. 

**WORK IN PROGRESS: currently not suitable for any usage**



### Overriding skeleton
This bundle is highly extensible. The entity is generated through twig-files, which you can overwrite or
extend by adding files with identical names to 
`{projectDir}/templates/bundles/EntityGeneratorBundle/skeleton`.
